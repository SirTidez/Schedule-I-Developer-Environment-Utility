# ManagedEnvironment Refresh Enhancement

## Issue
Ensuring the ManagedEnvironment window properly refreshes when versions are switched in the VersionManagerDialog.

## Enhancement
Added comprehensive refresh mechanism to ensure the main window updates immediately when versions are switched.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Version Change Handler
- Modified `handleVersionChange` in ManagedEnvironment.tsx to call `loadConfig()` before `loadBranches()`
- This ensures the latest active version data is loaded from the config before refreshing the UI

### 2. Added Debugging
- Added console logs to track the refresh process
- Logs show when version change is detected and when refresh completes
- Added detailed logging in `loadBranches` to show active version data being loaded

### 3. Improved Refresh Flow
- VersionManagerDialog calls `onVersionChange` callback
- ManagedEnvironment receives the callback and refreshes config first
- Then refreshes branches to update all UI elements
- This ensures the build ID, action buttons, and other values reflect the new active branch

## Technical Details
The refresh flow now works as follows:
1. User clicks "Set Active" in VersionManagerDialog
2. VersionManagerDialog calls config service to update active version
3. VersionManagerDialog calls `onVersionChange` callback
4. ManagedEnvironment receives callback and calls `loadConfig()`
5. ManagedEnvironment calls `loadBranches()` with updated config
6. UI updates with new active version information

## Files Modified
- `src/renderer/components/ManagedEnvironment/ManagedEnvironment.tsx`
- `src/renderer/components/VersionManager/VersionManagerDialog.tsx`

## Testing
The debugging logs will help verify that:
- Version change callbacks are being triggered
- Config is being refreshed with latest data
- Branches are being reloaded with updated active versions
- UI elements reflect the new active branch
