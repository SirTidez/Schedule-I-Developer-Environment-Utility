# Version Manager Loading UX Improvement

## Enhancement
Added toast notifications and prevented dialog closing during version switching to improve user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Toast Notification System
- Added `toastMsg` state to VersionManagerDialog
- Shows "Switching to new version..." during the loading process
- Shows "Version switched successfully!" when complete
- Toast automatically disappears after 3 seconds

### 2. Dialog Closing Prevention
- Disabled close button (X) in header while loading
- Disabled close button in footer while loading
- Prevented clicking outside dialog to close while loading
- Added visual feedback (grayed out, cursor not-allowed) for disabled state

### 3. Loading State Management
- Enhanced `handleSetActive` and `handleSetActiveManifest` functions
- Clear error handling with toast cleanup
- Proper loading state management throughout the process

## User Experience Improvements
- Users now see clear feedback when switching versions
- Dialog cannot be accidentally closed during the switching process
- Success confirmation provides confidence that the operation completed
- Loading states are visually clear and consistent
