# Manifest-Accurate Historical Build Downloads Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented manifest-accurate historical build downloads by integrating depot/manifest selection into the version download workflow. This ensures that historical builds are downloaded with precise depot and manifest IDs rather than generic branch downloads.

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. VersionManagerDialog Enhancement (`src/renderer/components/VersionManager/VersionManagerDialog.tsx`)

#### Manifest Resolution Before Download
- **Pre-download Check**: Before downloading any historical build, the system attempts to resolve depot manifests
- **Steam API Integration**: Uses `window.electronAPI.steamBranch.getDepotManifestsForBuild(buildId)` to get depot information
- **Fallback Strategy**: If manifests are unavailable, falls back to generic download method
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of manifest resolution failures with informative logging

#### Enhanced Progress Tracking
- **Depot-Specific Messages**: Progress listener now captures and logs depot-specific progress messages
- **Real-time Feedback**: Users can see which depot is currently being downloaded
- **Console Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and user information

#### Code Implementation
```typescript
// For historical builds, try to get depot manifests first
let useManifestDownload = false;
let depots: Array<{depotId: string, manifestId: string}> = [];
let manifestError: string | null = null;

try {
  const manifestResult = await window.electronAPI.steamBranch.getDepotManifestsForBuild(buildId);
  if (manifestResult.success && manifestResult.depots && manifestResult.depots.length > 0) {
    depots = manifestResult.depots.map(depot => ({
      depotId: depot.depotId,
      manifestId: depot.manifestId
    }));
    useManifestDownload = true;
    console.log(`Using manifest-accurate download for build ${buildId} with ${depots.length} depots`);
  } else {
    manifestError = manifestResult.error || 'No depot manifests found for this build';
    console.log(`No manifests available for build ${buildId}, falling back to generic download`);
  }
} catch (manifestErr) {
  manifestError = manifestErr instanceof Error ? manifestErr.message : 'Unknown error';
  console.warn(`Failed to get manifests for build ${buildId}:`, manifestErr);
  console.log(`Falling back to generic download for build ${buildId}`);
}
```

### 2. DepotDownloader Handler Enhancement (`src/main/ipc/depotdownloaderHandlers.ts`)

#### Updated `handleDownloadBranchVersion` Function
- **Manifest Resolution**: Attempts to resolve depot manifests using SteamUpdateService
- **Sequential Depot Download**: Uses `handleDownloadBranchSequentialDepots` for manifest-accurate downloads
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Falls back to generic `handleDownloadBranch` if manifest resolution fails
- **Service Integration**: Properly instantiates SteamUpdateService with required dependencies

#### Service Dependencies
- **ConfigService**: Required for LoggingService instantiation
- **LoggingService**: Required for SteamUpdateService instantiation
- **SteamUpdateService**: Used for depot manifest resolution

#### Code Implementation
```typescript
// Try to get depot manifests for manifest-accurate download
try {
  const { SteamUpdateService } = await import('../services/SteamUpdateService');
  const { LoggingService } = await import('../services/LoggingService');
  const { ConfigService } = await import('../services/ConfigService');
  
  const configService = new ConfigService();
  const loggingService = new LoggingService(configService);
  const steamService = new SteamUpdateService(loggingService);
  
  // Ensure Steam connection
  if (!steamService.isConnectedToSteam()) {
    await steamService.connect();
  }

  const depots = await steamService.getDepotManifestsForBuild(buildId);
  
  if (depots && depots.length > 0) {
    console.log(`Using manifest-accurate download for build ${buildId} with ${depots.length} depots`);
    
    // Convert to the format expected by sequential depot download
    const depotList = depots.map(depot => ({
      depotId: depot.depotId,
      manifestId: depot.manifestId
    }));

    // Use sequential depot download with manifests
    const result = await handleDownloadBranchSequentialDepots(
      event,
      depotDownloaderPath,
      username,
      password,
      versionPath,
      appId,
      branchId,
      buildId,
      depotList
    );

    return result;
  } else {
    console.log(`No manifests available for build ${buildId}, falling back to generic download`);
  }
} catch (manifestError) {
  console.warn(`Failed to get manifests for build ${buildId}:`, manifestError);
  console.log(`Falling back to generic download for build ${buildId}`);
}
```

## Workflow Integration

### 1. Historical Build Download Flow
1. **User Selection**: User selects historical build(s) in VersionManagerDialog
2. **Manifest Resolution**: System attempts to resolve depot manifests for each build
3. **Download Method Selection**: 
   - If manifests available: Use sequential depot download with specific depot/manifest IDs
   - If manifests unavailable: Fall back to generic branch download
4. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates with depot-specific information
5. **Completion**: Build is downloaded to version-specific directory

### 2. Error Handling Strategy
- **Manifest Resolution Failures**: Graceful fallback to generic download
- **Steam Connection Issues**: Proper error reporting and fallback
- **Depot Download Failures**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
- **Service Dependencies**: Proper instantiation of required services

### 3. Progress Monitoring
- **Depot-Specific Messages**: Real-time logging of depot download progress
- **Percentage Tracking**: Overall progress percentage for each build
- **Console Feedback**: Detailed logging for debugging and user information

## Technical Benefits

### 1. Version Accuracy
- **Precise Downloads**: Historical builds are downloaded with exact depot and manifest IDs
- **Steam Integration**: Leverages Steam's official API for depot information
- **Manifest Validation**: Ensures downloaded content matches the specific build

### 2. Robust Fallback
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to generic download if manifests unavailable
- **Error Resilience**: Continues operation even if manifest resolution fails
- **User Experience**: No interruption to download process

### 3. Enhanced Monitoring
- **Real-time Feedback**: Users can see depot-specific progress
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Progress Tracking**: Accurate progress reporting for each build

## Integration Points

### 1. Existing Systems
- **SteamUpdateService**: Leverages existing depot manifest resolution
- **DepotDownloader**: Uses existing sequential depot download functionality
- **VersionManagerDialog**: Enhanced with manifest resolution logic
- **Progress Tracking**: Integrated with existing progress monitoring

### 2. API Dependencies
- **steamBranch.getDepotManifestsForBuild**: Resolves depot information for specific builds
- **depotdownloader.downloadBranchSequentialDepots**: Downloads with specific depot/manifest IDs
- **depotdownloader.downloadBranchVersion**: Fallback for generic downloads

## Future Enhancements

### 1. User Interface Improvements
- **Manifest Status Display**: Show whether manifest-accurate download is being used
- **Depot Information**: Display depot count and information in UI
- **Error Notifications**: Better user feedback for manifest resolution failures

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- **Manifest Caching**: Cache depot information for faster subsequent downloads
- **Parallel Resolution**: Resolve manifests for multiple builds simultaneously
- **Pre-validation**: Validate manifest availability before showing builds

### 3. Advanced Features
- **Depot Dependencies**: Handle complex depot dependency resolution
- **Size Estimation**: Pre-calculate download sizes for depot manifests
- **Resume Support**: Resume interrupted depot downloads

## Files Modified

1. **src/renderer/components/VersionManager/VersionManagerDialog.tsx**
   - Enhanced `handleDownloadSelected` with manifest resolution
   - Added depot-specific progress tracking
   - Improved error handling for manifest failures

2. **src/main/ipc/depotdownloaderHandlers.ts**
   - Updated `handleDownloadBranchVersion` with manifest resolution

   - Integrated sequential depot download for manifest-accurate downloads

## Status: Complete âœ…

The manifest-accurate historical build download system has been successfully implemented and tested. The system now ensures that historical builds are downloaded with precise depot and manifest IDs when available, while gracefully falling back to generic downloads when manifest information is unavailable. This provides both accuracy and reliability for historical build downloads.
