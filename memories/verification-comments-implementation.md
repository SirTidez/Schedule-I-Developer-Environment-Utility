# Verification Comments Implementation

## Comment 1: Partial Migration Enablement

**Issue**: Start migration was disabled when any legacy install lacked a manifestId, blocking partial migration.

**Solution**: Implemented partial migration enablement in `src/renderer/components/MigrationDialog.tsx`:

1. **Button Logic Change**: Replaced `legacyInstallations.some(i => !i.manifestId)` with `legacyInstallations.every(i => !i.manifestId)` in the Start button disable condition
2. **User Communication**: Added explanatory note in the migration step UI: "Only installations with a resolved manifest ID will be migrated. Others can be retried after resolving Steam library detection."
3. **UI Enhancement**: Added blue info box with Info icon to clearly communicate the partial migration behavior

**Result**: Users can now start migration if at least one legacy installation has a valid `manifestId`, while clearly understanding that only those will be migrated.

## Comment 2: Clean Identifier Assignment

**Issue**: `listBranchVersions` was assigning prefixed directory name to `buildId` for manifest_* entries, causing identifier mixing.

**Solution**: Corrected identifier assignment in `src/main/utils/pathUtils.ts`:

1. **Manifest Case Fix**: Changed `buildId = entry.name;` to `buildId = manifestId;` for manifest_* entries
2. **Consistency**: Ensured clean, unprefixed IDs are used for logical comparisons
3. **Preserved Behavior**: Left build_* branch unchanged (`buildId = entry.name.replace('build_', '')`)

**Result**:

- Manifest entries now have clean `buildId` values matching their `manifestId`
- Active status comparisons work correctly (e.g., `version.buildId === activeBuildId`)
- UI display avoids showing prefixed names in version lists
- Conditional logic `version.manifestId && version.manifestId !== version.buildId` works as intended

## Files Modified

- `src/renderer/components/MigrationDialog.tsx` - Partial migration enablement
- `src/main/utils/pathUtils.ts` - Clean identifier assignment

## Testing Notes

- Migration dialog now enables Start button when any installation has manifestId
- Version manager displays clean identifiers without prefixes
- Active version detection works correctly for both build and manifest entries
