# Placeholder Reconciliation Implementation (2025-01-10)

## Overview
Added a method to `ConfigService.ts` to reconcile placeholders after migration by replacing entries where `manifestId===buildId` with real manifest IDs discovered by `VersionMigrationService` and cleaning up obsolete keys.

## Implementation Details

### Method: `reconcilePlaceholdersAfterMigration`
- **Location**: `src/main/services/ConfigService.ts` (lines 464-574)
- **Purpose**: Replaces temporary placeholder entries with actual manifest IDs after migration
- **Parameters**: `manifestMappings: Record<string, Record<string, string>>` - Map of buildId to real manifestId for each branch
- **Returns**: `Promise<{success: boolean, reconciledCount: number, errors: string[]}>`

### Key Features

#### 1. Placeholder Detection
- Identifies entries where `manifestId === buildId` (temporary placeholders)
- Processes each branch individually for targeted reconciliation

#### 2. Manifest ID Replacement
- Replaces placeholder entries with real manifest IDs from migration service
- Creates new entries with correct manifest IDs
- Removes old placeholder entries
- Updates active manifest references

#### 3. Obsolete Key Cleanup
- Identifies and removes obsolete keys that no longer correspond to real manifest IDs
- Ensures clean configuration state after reconciliation

#### 4. Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging
- Tracks reconciliation count and errors
- Graceful handling of missing manifest ID mappings

### Usage Pattern
```typescript
// After VersionMigrationService completes migration
const manifestMappings = {
  'public': {
    '12345': 'real-manifest-id-1',
    '67890': 'real-manifest-id-2'
  },
  'beta': {
    '11111': 'real-manifest-id-3'
  }
};

const result = await configService.reconcilePlaceholdersAfterMigration(manifestMappings);
```

### Benefits
1. **Clean Configuration**: Removes temporary placeholder entries after migration
2. **Data Integrity**: Ensures manifest IDs are accurate and up-to-date
3. **Performance**: Eliminates obsolete keys that could cause confusion
4. **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
5. **Integration**: Seamlessly works with existing VersionMigrationService

## Files Modified
- `src/main/services/ConfigService.ts`: Added `reconcilePlaceholdersAfterMigration` method

## Status: Complete âœ…
The placeholder reconciliation method is fully implemented and ready for use after migration processes complete.
