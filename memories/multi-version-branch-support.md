# Multi-Version Branch Support Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive multi-version branch support for the Schedule I Developer Environment Utility, transitioning from a single-version-per-branch system to a robust multi-version management system.

## Key Changes

### 1. Data Model Updates (`src/shared/types.ts`)
- Extended `BranchBuildInfo` with optional fields: `sizeBytes`, `downloadDate`, `isActive`
- Added `BranchVersionInfo` interface for individual version management
- Updated `DevEnvironmentConfig` with new multi-version structure:
  - `branchVersions`: Nested structure for version management
  - `activeBuildPerBranch`: Maps branch names to active build IDs
  - `maxRecentBuilds`: Configurable limit for recent builds display
- Enhanced `BranchInfo` interface with version-related fields

### 2. Path Management (`src/main/utils/pathUtils.ts`)
- Created centralized path utility module
- Functions for branch base paths, version-specific paths, and active branch paths
- Legacy structure detection and migration capabilities
- Directory listing and validation functions

### 3. Steam Integration (`src/main/ipc/steamBranchHandlers.ts`)
- New IPC handlers for Steam branch version management
- `steam:list-branch-builds`: Fetch recent build history
- `steam:get-current-branch-buildid`: Get current build ID
- `steam:get-installed-versions`: List installed versions

### 4. Download System Updates (`src/main/ipc/depotdownloaderHandlers.ts`)
- Enhanced `handleDownloadBranch` to support version-specific downloads
- New `handleDownloadBranchVersion` for explicit version downloads
- Legacy branch migration support
- Version-specific path construction

### 5. Configuration Management (`src/main/services/ConfigService.ts`)
- Added multi-version configuration methods
- Legacy configuration migration logic
- Active build management per branch
- Recent builds count configuration

### 6. File Operations (`src/main/ipc/fileHandlers.ts`)
- Added `file:migrate-legacy-branch` handler
- Integration with new path utilities
- Legacy structure detection and migration

### 7. UI Components
- **VersionManagerDialog** (`src/renderer/components/VersionManager/VersionManagerDialog.tsx`): Complete version management interface
- **ManagedEnvironment** updates: Multi-version display and management
- **SettingsDialog** updates: `maxRecentBuilds` configuration
- **CopyProgressStep** updates: Version-specific path handling

### 8. IPC Integration
- Updated `src/preload/index.ts` with new IPC method exposures
- Updated `src/main/index.ts` to register new handlers
- Complete TypeScript type definitions

## Migration Strategy
- Automatic detection of legacy branch structures
- Graceful migration from flat to versioned directory structure
- Preservation of existing downloads during migration
- Backward compatibility with existing configurations

## Path Structure Changes
**Before:** `managed-env/branches/{branch-id}/`
**After:** `managed-env/branches/{branch-id}/{build-id}/`

## Features Implemented
- Multiple version downloads per branch
- Active version selection and management
- Recent builds listing and download
- Legacy structure migration
- Version-specific file operations
- Configurable recent builds display limit
- Complete UI for version management

## Technical Architecture
- Centralized path management through `pathUtils`
- Service-based configuration management
- IPC-based communication between main and renderer processes
- React-based UI components with state management
- TypeScript type safety throughout

## Testing Considerations
- Legacy migration testing required
- Version download and management testing
- UI interaction testing for version manager
- Configuration migration validation

## Future Enhancements
- Steam API integration for historical build data
- Advanced version comparison features
- Automated version cleanup
- Version-specific launch configurations

This implementation provides a solid foundation for multi-version branch management while maintaining backward compatibility and ensuring a smooth user experience.
