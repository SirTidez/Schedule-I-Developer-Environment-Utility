# Manifest Selection Implementation for Schedule I Developer Environment Utility

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive manifest selection functionality for depot downloads using the SteamUpdateService and DepotDownloader integration. This allows for precise version-specific downloads by resolving depot IDs and manifest IDs for specific builds.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. SteamUpdateService Extensions (`src/main/services/SteamUpdateService.ts`)
- **DepotInfo Interface**: Added to shared types for depot information
- **getDepotManifestsForBuild()**: Resolves depot and manifest IDs for a specific build ID
- **getDepotManifestsForBranch()**: Gets depot information for a specific branch and optional build ID
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for Steam API operations

### 2. Steam Branch IPC Handlers (`src/main/ipc/steamBranchHandlers.ts`)
- **steam:get-depot-manifests-for-build**: Get depot manifests for a specific build ID
- **steam:get-depot-manifests-for-branch**: Get depot manifests for a specific branch
- **steam:get-branch-buildid**: Get current build ID for a branch
- **steam:get-all-branch-buildids**: Get all available branch build IDs
- **Automatic Steam Connection**: Ensures Steam connection before operations

### 3. Enhanced DepotDownloader Handlers (`src/main/ipc/depotdownloaderHandlers.ts`)
- **Depot-Specific Downloads**: Support for `-depot <id> -manifest <manifestId>` arguments
- **Sequential Depot Downloads**: Orchestrated downloads of multiple depots
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates for depot downloads
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for depot-specific operations

### 4. Preload API Exposure (`src/preload/index.ts`)
- **steamBranch API**: New API section for depot/manifest operations
- **depotdownloader Extensions**: New methods for manifest-specific downloads
- **TypeScript Definitions**: Complete type definitions for all new APIs

## Usage Examples

### Getting Depot Information for a Build
```typescript
// Get depot information for a specific build ID
const result = await window.electronAPI.steamBranch.getDepotManifestsForBuild('12345678');
if (result.success && result.depots) {
  console.log(`Found ${result.depots.length} depots for build`);
  result.depots.forEach(depot => {
    console.log(`Depot ${depot.depotId}: Manifest ${depot.manifestId}`);
  });
}
```

### Downloading with Specific Manifests
```typescript
// Download a branch with specific depot and manifest information
const depots = [
  { depotId: '3164501', manifestId: '19748475' },
  { depotId: '3164502', manifestId: '19748476' }
];

const result = await window.electronAPI.depotdownloader.downloadBranchWithManifests(
  depotDownloaderPath,
  username,
  password,
  branchPath,
  appId,
  branchId,
  buildId,
  depots
);
```

### Sequential Depot Downloads
```typescript
// Download multiple depots sequentially with progress tracking
const result = await window.electronAPI.depotdownloader.downloadBranchSequentialDepots(
  depotDownloaderPath,
  username,
  password,
  branchPath,
  appId,
  branchId,
  buildId,
  depots
);

if (result.success) {
  console.log(`Successfully downloaded ${result.completedDepots} depots`);
}
```

## Workflow Integration

### 1. Build Resolution
1. User selects a specific build ID
2. System calls `steamBranch.getDepotManifestsForBuild(buildId)`
3. SteamUpdateService resolves depot and manifest IDs
4. Returns array of DepotInfo objects

### 2. Depot Download Orchestration
1. System receives depot information
2. Calls `depotdownloader.downloadBranchSequentialDepots()` with depot data
3. DepotDownloader downloads each depot with `-depot <id> -manifest <manifestId>`
4. Progress updates sent to renderer process
5. Completion status reported

### 3. Error Handling
- Steam connection failures
- Invalid build IDs
- Depot download failures
- Manifest resolution errors
- Network connectivity issues

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
User Request → SteamUpdateService → Steam API → Depot Info → DepotDownloader → File System
```

### Key Features
- **Precise Version Control**: Download exact builds using manifest IDs
- **Sequential Processing**: Controlled depot downloads with progress tracking
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling and reporting
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time progress updates for user feedback
- **Steam Integration**: Seamless integration with Steam's PICS system

## Benefits

1. **Version Accuracy**: Ensures exact build downloads using Steam's manifest system
2. **Efficient Downloads**: Only downloads required depots for specific builds
3. **Progress Visibility**: Users can track depot download progress
4. **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery
5. **Steam Integration**: Leverages Steam's official API for depot information

## Future Enhancements

- **Parallel Depot Downloads**: Option to download multiple depots simultaneously
- **Depot Size Estimation**: Pre-download size calculations
- **Depot Dependencies**: Handle depot dependency resolution
- **Caching**: Cache depot information for faster subsequent operations
- **Resume Support**: Resume interrupted depot downloads

This implementation provides a solid foundation for precise version-specific downloads while maintaining compatibility with existing branch management functionality.
