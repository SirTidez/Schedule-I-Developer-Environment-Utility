#### 3. Configuration Service Integration ✅
- **Types**: SteamCMD fields (`useSteamCMD`, `steamCMDPath`) already present in `DevEnvironmentConfig`
- **ConfigService**: Already handles SteamCMD configuration with proper defaults
- **Persistence**: Configuration is automatically saved and loaded on app restart

### Technical Implementation Details

#### App Launch Flow
1. **Initial Load**: App checks for existing SteamCMD configuration
2. **SteamCMD Setup**: If no configuration exists, shows SteamCMD setup window
3. **Configuration Save**: User's SteamCMD choice is saved to configuration
4. **Main Flow**: Proceeds to normal configuration check and interface selection

#### State Management
- **showSteamCMDSetup**: Controls whether to show SteamCMD setup window
- **steamCMDConfig**: Stores the user's SteamCMD configuration choice
- **Integration**: Seamless transition from SteamCMD setup to main application flow

#### User Experience
- **First Launch**: Users see SteamCMD setup immediately upon app launch
- **Subsequent Launches**: App remembers SteamCMD choice and skips setup
- **Configuration**: SteamCMD settings are persistent across app restarts
- **Flexibility**: Users can still access setup wizard or managed environment after SteamCMD setup

### Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistent Entry Point**: All users see SteamCMD setup on first launch
2. **Configuration Persistence**: SteamCMD choice is remembered across sessions
3. **Seamless Integration**: Smooth transition from setup to main application
4. **User Choice**: Clear decision point between automated (SteamCMD) and manual (copy) methods
5. **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of configuration errors

### Files Modified
- **src/renderer/App.tsx**: Added SteamCMD setup integration to app launch flow
- **memories/memory.md**: Documented the SteamCMD setup integration implementation

## Status: SteamCMD Setup Integration Complete ✅

The SteamCMD setup window now appears at app launch before showing the setup wizard or managed environment window. Users can configure their SteamCMD preferences on first launch, and the application remembers their choice for subsequent launches. This provides a consistent entry point and clear decision point for users to choose between automated SteamCMD downloads and manual file copying.

## SteamCMD Path Handling Fix (2025-01-10) ✅

### Completed Tasks (SteamCMD Path Handling Fix)

#### 1. Path with Spaces Issue Identified ✅
- **Problem**: SteamCMD validation failed with exit code 1 when path contained spaces
- **Root Cause**: `spawn()` command not properly handling paths with spaces in directory names
- **Example Path**: `D:\Schedule 1 Modding\Dev Env\steamcmd\steamcmd.exe`

#### 2. Path Quoting Solution Implemented ✅
- **steamcmdHandlers.ts**: Updated all `spawn()` calls to quote paths with spaces
- **Solution**: Wrap executable path in quotes: `"${steamcmdExe}"`
- **Functions Fixed**:
  - `handleValidateInstallation()` - SteamCMD validation
  - `handleLogin()` - Steam login functionality  
  - `handleDownloadBranch()` - Branch download operations

#### 3. Testing and Verification ✅
- **Build Process**: Main process rebuilds successfully after changes
- **Path Handling**: Verified that quoted paths work correctly with spaces
- **Development Server**: Application runs without SteamCMD validation errors

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Path Quoting Solution
```javascript
// Before (fails with spaces)
const steamcmd = spawn(steamcmdExe, ['+quit'], { shell: true });

// After (works with spaces)
const quotedPath = `"${steamcmdExe}"`;
const steamcmd = spawn(quotedPath, ['+quit'], { shell: true });
```

#### Functions Updated
- **Validation**: `handleValidateInstallation()` - Tests SteamCMD installation
- **Authentication**: `handleLogin()` - Handles Steam login process
- **Download**: `handleDownloadBranch()` - Downloads game branches

### Benefits Achieved

1. **Path Compatibility**: SteamCMD now works with paths containing spaces
2. **User Experience**: No more validation failures for common SteamCMD installation locations
3. **Robustness**: Handles various SteamCMD installation directory structures
4. **Cross-Platform**: Solution works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

### Files Modified
- **src/main/ipc/steamcmdHandlers.ts**: Added path quoting for all spawn calls

const checkOutput = (data: string) => {
  // Check if Steam Guard is required
  if (fullOutput.includes('Steam Guard') || fullOutput.includes('mobile authenticator')) {
    steamGuardRequired = true;
    // Send progress update to renderer
    event.sender.send('steamcmd-progress', {
      type: 'steam-guard',
      message: 'Steam Guard authentication required. Please confirm the login in your Steam Mobile app.'
    });
  }

  // Check for successful login completion
  if (fullOutput.includes('Logging in user') && fullOutput.includes('OK') && 
      fullOutput.includes('Waiting for client config') && fullOutput.includes('OK') &&
      fullOutput.includes('Waiting for user info') && fullOutput.includes('OK')) {
    loginCompleted = true;
    resolve({ success: true });
  }
};
```

#### UI State Management
- **steamGuardRequired**: Boolean state for Steam Guard requirement
