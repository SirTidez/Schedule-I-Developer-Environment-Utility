# WinUI3 Refactor Memory Log

## Phase 1 Progress (Base Systems)

### Completed ✅
- Set up dependency injection in App.xaml.cs
- Created Models folder and migrated DevEnvironmentConfig, BranchInfo, SteamGameInfo, BranchBuildInfo
- Created Services folder and migrated SteamService, ConfigurationService, FileLoggingService
- Created base ViewModels with INotifyPropertyChanged
- Updated project file with required dependencies

### Current Issue ❌
**XAML Compilation Error**: The WinUI3 XAML compiler is failing with exit code 1. This is preventing the build from completing.

**Error Details**:
- MSB3073 error from XamlCompiler.exe
- Occurs during XAML compilation phase
- No specific error details visible in build output

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. Simplified XAML to basic Grid with TextBlocks
2. Removed complex data binding (x:Bind)
3. Cleaned project artifacts
4. Used manual UI updates instead of MVVM binding

### Current State
- All base systems (Models, Services) are migrated and ready
- Basic UI structure created but not compiling
- Need to resolve XAML compilation issue before proceeding to Phase 2

### Troubleshooting Attempts
1. ✅ Updated workloads with `dotnet workload update`
2. ✅ Tried different WindowsAppSDK versions (1.7.x → 1.6.x)
3. ✅ Simplified XAML to minimal content (single TextBlock)
4. ✅ Created console test to validate services independently
5. ❌ XAML compiler still fails even with minimal XAML

### Phase 1 Achievement ✅
**All core business logic successfully migrated!**
- Models: All data structures ported
- Services: SteamService, ConfigurationService, FileLoggingService ready
- Dependency Injection: Properly configured
- Architecture: Clean separation, ready for Phase 2

### Next Steps Options
1. **Create standalone console app** to demonstrate functionality
2. **Try WPF instead of WinUI3** (less modern but more reliable)  
3. **Debug XAML compiler environment issue** (may require VS install)
4. **Continue with console testing** to validate Phase 2 features
