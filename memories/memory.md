# Schedule I Developer Environment Utility - Electron Conversion Progress

## Project Overview
Successfully initiated the conversion of the C# WinUI 3 application "Schedule I Developer Environment Utility" to an Electron-based web UI application. The conversion maintains feature parity while providing cross-platform compatibility and modern development tools.

## Recent Fixes (2024-12-19)

### Manifest to Build Directory Copy Fix ✅
- **Issue**: DepotDownloader was downloading builds to `manifest_<manifest_id>` folders, but the application expected builds to be in `build_<manifest_id>` folders
- **Root Cause**: DepotDownloader downloads to manifest directories, but MelonLoader and other components expect build directories
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `copyManifestContentsToBuildDirectory()` and `cleanupEmptyManifestDirectory()` helper functions
  - Updated all download functions to copy contents from manifest directories to build directories after successful downloads
  - Updated MelonLoader installation to use build directory instead of manifest directory
  - Automatic cleanup of empty manifest folders after copy
- **Impact**: Ensures all builds are in `build_<manifest_id>` directories for consistency, MelonLoader installs to correct directory, and proper cleanup of manifest folders
- **Files Modified**: `src/main/ipc/depotdownloaderHandlers.ts`, `src/renderer/components/SetupWizard/steps/CopyProgressStep.tsx`
- **Details**: Non-breaking enhancement that improves directory organization and ensures consistent path references throughout the application

### Branch Path Construction Fix ✅
- **Issue**: Setup wizard was creating incorrect directory structures with nested `branches` folders when downloading branches using DepotDownloader
- **Root Cause**: Components were manually constructing branch paths using string concatenation instead of centralized utility functions
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `pathUtils` IPC handlers to expose path utility functions to renderer process
  - Updated all components to use `window.electronAPI.pathUtils.getBranchVersionPath()` instead of manual string concatenation
  - Fixed path construction in CopyProgressStep, ManagedEnvironment, CopyProgress, and DefaultModsProgress components
- **Impact**: Eliminates nested `branches` directory issue and ensures consistent path construction across all components
- **Files Modified**: `src/main/ipc/pathUtilsHandlers.ts` (new), `src/preload/index.ts`, `src/main/index.ts`, multiple renderer components
- **Details**: Now creates correct structure `Dev Env/branches/branch-name/manifest_id/` instead of `Dev Env/branches/branches/branch-name/`

### parseAppManifest JSDoc Documentation Enhancement ✅
- **Issue**: The `parseAppManifest` method in `SteamService.ts` lacked clear documentation about the `libraryPath` parameter format
- **Solution**: Updated JSDoc to specify that `libraryPath` must be the steamapps folder path, not the library root
- **Impact**: Improves developer understanding and prevents incorrect usage
- **Files Modified**: `src/main/services/SteamService.ts`, `src/main/services/VersionMigrationService.ts`
- **Details**: Added clarifying comments in `VersionMigrationService.ts` to document that paths are already in correct format

### parseAppManifest Path Construction Fix ✅
- **Issue**: The `parseAppManifest` method in `SteamService.ts` was incorrectly constructing manifest paths by adding `'steamapps'` to the `libraryPath` parameter
- **Root Cause**: The method was treating steamapps paths as Steam library root paths and incorrectly appending `'steamapps'` to them
- **Solution**: Updated path construction from `path.join(libraryPath, 'steamapps', ...)` to `path.join(libraryPath, ...)`
- **Impact**: Fixes "manifest not found" errors when parsing Steam app manifests
- **Files Modified**: `src/main/services/SteamService.ts`
