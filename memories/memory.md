# WinUI3 Refactor Memory Log

## Phase 1 Progress (Base Systems) ✅

### Completed ✅
- Set up dependency injection in App.xaml.cs
- Created Models folder and migrated DevEnvironmentConfig, BranchInfo, SteamGameInfo, BranchBuildInfo
- Created Services folder and migrated SteamService, ConfigurationService, FileLoggingService
- Created base ViewModels with INotifyPropertyChanged
- Updated project file with required dependencies

### Issue Resolution ✅ 
**Problem**: NullReferenceException in Release builds when creating `ManagedEnvironmentWindow`
**Root Cause**: .NET Release mode had `PublishTrimmed=True` which was removing WinUI3 types and dependencies needed for XAML/reflection
**Solution**: 
1. Disabled trimming (`PublishTrimmed=False`) for WinUI3 compatibility
2. Disabled ReadyToRun optimization to prevent runtime package issues  
3. Added defensive error handling in ViewModels and Window constructors
4. Set default RuntimeIdentifier for Release builds (win-x64)
5. Added TrimmerRootDescriptor to preserve critical assemblies

### Self-Contained Release Build ✅
**Configuration**: Updated project to create self-contained executable with embedded dependencies
**Properties Added**:
- `SelfContained=true` - Include .NET runtime 
- `IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true` - Include native libraries
- `CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies=true` - Copy all dependencies

**Result**: Complete standalone executable at:
`D:\Schedule 1 Modding\Schedule I Developer Environment Utility\bin\Release\net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0\win-x64\publish\Schedule I Developer Environment Utility.exe`

**Dependencies Included**:
- Full .NET 8 runtime (coreclr.dll, clrjit.dll, etc.)
- All Microsoft.Extensions.* libraries
- Complete WinUI3 and WindowsAppSDK dependencies
- All custom application assemblies
- Native libraries and WinRT projections

### Current Status ✅
- **Release build**: Compiles successfully with all dependencies embedded
- **Debug build**: Still works as before
- **Runtime safety**: Added defensive coding to prevent crashes
- **All core services**: Fully migrated and functional
- **NRE Resolution**: The original NullReferenceException in ManagedEnvironmentViewModel is now resolved
- **Deployment Ready**: Self-contained executable requires no additional runtime installation

### File Structure Created
```
- Models/
  - DevEnvironmentConfig.cs
  - BranchInfo.cs  
  - BranchBuildInfo.cs
  - SteamGameInfo.cs
- Services/
  - SteamService.cs
  - ConfigurationService.cs
  - FileLoggingService.cs
- ViewModels/
  - BaseViewModel.cs
  - MainWindowViewModel.cs
  - ManagedEnvironmentViewModel.cs (✅ NRE fixed)
- App.xaml.cs (with DI setup)
- MainWindow.xaml (basic UI)
- MainWindow.xaml.cs (code-behind)
```

### Final Status ✅
**Primary Issue Resolved**: The user's critical NullReferenceException in Release profile has been fixed. The ManagedEnvironmentWindow and ManagedEnvironmentViewModel now create successfully without NRE in Release builds.

**Self-Contained Deployment**: The Release executable now includes all required dependencies embedded within the application folder, eliminating runtime dependency issues.

**User Request Satisfied**: The user specifically wanted "to release it in the release profile, not debug" - this is now fully accomplished with a standalone, distributable Release build.

**Build Command**: `dotnet publish "Schedule I Developer Environment Utility.csproj" -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true`

**Final Executable Location**: 
`D:\Schedule 1 Modding\Schedule I Developer Environment Utility\bin\Release\net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0\win-x64\publish\Schedule I Developer Environment Utility.exe`
